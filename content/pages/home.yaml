      I made my first website in 1996, aged 13, hosted on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">GeoCities</a> and
      was hooked straight away. I thought it was incredible to have published
      something that anyone in the world could see, and made sure it was the
      best it could be, with animated GIFs, tiled backgrounds and as many
      colours as possible. It wasn't long before I discovered JavaScript, and my
      first scripts were to break out of the GeoCities advertising frames
      &#128064; and to implement rollover images.

    description: >-
      I've always enjoyed making things, particularly with wood. With building
      websites being so transient, it's a great way to make something tangible,
      long-lasting and useful in the analog world. I recently reduced my
      full-time hours for a few months and spent a day a week with a friend,
      <a href="https://www.mwrobinson.co.uk/">Mike Robinson</a>, who makes
      high-end bespoke furniture. Read my

      class at the <a href="https://e5bakehouse.com/">E5 Bakehouse</a>, and I've
      been baking ever since. It's an excellent introduction and thoroughly
      recommend it.
